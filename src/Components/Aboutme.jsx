        <h4>Web Development</h4>
        <p>
        I am an enthusiastic and technological freak with good understanding and huge hunger for constant development and improvement.
 I am positive, committed, knowledge-seeking and hard-working.
Programming is my passion and hobby.

I enjoy to create  beautiful design, intuitive, functional websites and Appliations with React.Js. Moreover, I am familiar with Backend technologies namely Nodejs, Express and  NoSQL which make me an ideal member of a web development team as I can combine my knowledge from both Backend and Front end and utilize them to achieve the set goals.
